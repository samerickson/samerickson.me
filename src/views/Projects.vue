          This project was created to determine the average wins and losses that
          will result in a set number of craps games, and what the longest win
          and lose streaks would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plan is to be able to specify <code>startingCash</code>
          and completely simulate a game with a predetermined betting
          strategy and print the output to the user.
