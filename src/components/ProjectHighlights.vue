      <p>
        This project was created to determine the average wins and losses that
        will result in a set number of craps games, and what the longest win
        and lose streaks would be.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plan is to be able to specify <code>startingCash</code>
        and completely simulate a game with a predetermined betting
        strategy and print the output to the user.
